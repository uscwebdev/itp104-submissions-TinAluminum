                <h2>History of 3D printing</h2>
                <img class="left" style="width: 160px; height: auto; padding-right: 15px;" src="img/3dprinthistory.webp" alt="first 3D printer">
                <p>The earliest 3D printer originated in 1981, when Dr. Hideo Kodama invented one of the first 
                    rapid prototyping machines that created parts layer by layer, using a resin that could be 
                    polymerized by UV light. In 1986, the first patent for stereolithography (SLA) was filed by 
                    Chuck Hull, who is considered “the inventor of 3D printing” for creating and commercializing 
                    both SLA and the .stl format - the most common file type used for 3D printing.
                </p>

                <p>In 1988, Carl Deckard, a student at the University of Texas, licensed selective laser sintering 
                    (SLS) technology - another type of 3D printing that uses a laser to sinter powdered material into 
                    solid structures. Shortly after, in 1989, Scott Crump patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) - 
                    also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) - and founded Stratasys, one of the main players 
                    in the 3D printing industry to this day. That same year, Hull's company, 3D Systems Corporation, 
                    released the SLA-1 3D printer.

                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <img class="right" style="width: 200px; height: auto; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;" src="img/Heart3Dprint.jpg" alt="3D printed heart">
                <p>The first time I was introduced to 3D printing was when I was in 6th grade. Since then, 3D 
                    printing has become one of my favorite hobbies. I think that everyone should learn how to 
                    use a 3D printer as it is so versatile and helpful in so many ways. The first thing I ever 
                    printed was a Pokemon model I downloaded from the internet. 3D printing also got me to learn 
                    about 3D design and CAD early on, which allowed me to design so many cool things. One time, 
                    I helped design and print a handle for a giant air cannon for my club in high school. 
                </p>

                <p>Not only is 3D printing a fun hobby, but it has also helped me in my career. Currently, I'm a 
                    part of a 3D printing club, which teaches people about 3D printing. Also, last summer, I learned 
                    how to extract a 3D model from an MRI scan, which can be used to print a life-size model so that 
                    a surgeon can better understand their patient's organ before surgery.
